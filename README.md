# IoT_CyberAttack_Classification_Thesis
In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring the security of connected devices is of paramount importance. This project or Master's thesis aims to address this critical concern by proposing a robust framework for the classification of cyber attacks on IoT using advanced machine learning techniques. The research encompasses a detailed exploration of data visualization, feature engineering, feature selection, and model implementation to develop a comprehensive and effective defense mechanism against cyber threats targeting IoT devices.
